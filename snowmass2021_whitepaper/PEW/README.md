- Distributions of $\cos\theta_b$  obtained for $\ELER$ (left) and $\EREL$ (right). The generator distribution is the green histogram and the red and blue dots show the reconstructed distributions after correction charge for charge migration and two different methods for the correction for efficiency and acceptance.

- Reconstructed distribution of $x\equiv\frac{2|\beta|}{1+|\beta|}$ for the signal $e^+e^-\to\gamma Z$, $Z\to q\bar{q}$ and background events, at $\sqrt{s}=250$ GeV with an integrated luminosity of 250 fb$^{-1}$.}

- Reconstructed distribution of 2-jet invariant mass for the signal $e^+e^-\to\gamma Z$, $Z\to q\bar{q}$ and background events based on full detector simulation, at $\sqrt{s}=250$ GeV with an integrated luminosity of 900 fb$^{-1}$. Top two figures are in linear scale and bottom two are in logarithmic scale. The left two are for $P(e^-,e^+)=(-0.8,+0.3)$ and the right two are for $P(e^-,e^+)=(+0.8,-0.3)$.}
